# 🗂️ Data Redundancy Removal System (Task 2)

# Introduction
This project is a **Data Redundancy Removal System** built using **Python** and **MongoDB**.  
It prevents duplicate records from being stored in the database by generating a **SHA256 hash** for each entry.

# Features
✅ Insert new record (checks for duplicates before saving)  
✅ Bulk insert multiple records  
✅ View all stored records  
✅ Prevents redundancy using hashing  

---

# Technologies Used
1) Python 3  
2) MongoDB
3) PyMongo library  
4) Hashlib (for SHA256 hashing)  

# How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd <repo-name>
